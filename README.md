*Clara Happ, Fabian Scheipl, Alice-Agnes Gabriel, Sonja Greven (Department of Statistics / Department of Geophysics, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany).*

Full reference:  Happ C, Scheipl F, Gabriel A-A, Greven S. A general framework for multivariate functional principal component analysis of amplitude and phase variation. *Stat. 2019; 8:e220*. [Link to journal](https://doi.org/10.1002/sta4.220).

It provides:
 * Fully reproducible `R`-code for the toy example and all discussed transformations (SRVF, clr, log-quantile, log-hazard)
 * Data used in the application section
 * A reproduction script for the application
 * Utility functions 

  
## Usage ##

`R` functions are directly applicable. `R`-packages [`funData`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=funData) and [`MFPCA`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MFPCA) need to be installed.
